# Excel VBA Automation – Split Data by Column

## 📌 Problem

At work, I was given a task to split a master Excel sheet into separate sheets based on region.
Previously, this was done manually by copying, pasting, and deleting data—time-consuming and error-prone.

## 🚀 Solution

I automated the process using **Excel VBA**. With a single click, the code generates region-wise sheets automatically, reducing manual effort and avoiding mistakes.

## ⚡ Features

* Automatically splits data by unique region values.
* Creates separate sheets for each region.
* Eliminates manual copy-paste work.
* Reduces human error and saves time.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Open the VBA editor in Excel (`Alt + F11`).
2. Insert a new Module.
3. Copy-paste the VBA code from `RegionSplit.vba`.
4. Run the macro to generate region-wise sheets instantly.


## 📂 Example

Before: One master sheet with multiple regions.
After: Separate sheets automatically created for each region.
